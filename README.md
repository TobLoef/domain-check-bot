# @DomainCheckBot
A Twitter bot to check the availability of domains.

Just mention [@domaincheckbot](https://twitter.com/domaincheckbot) along with a domain, and it'll respond with the avilability status of the domain.

If you want to run this on your own machine, you'll need a keys.json file in the projects folder, looking something like this (This is just a random exmaple, you can get these keys through Twitter):
```
{
    "consumer_key": "K8utC2yGKrOrFDr1sMSCKZHLm",
    "consumer_secret": "RU6WuwOJGHXxBgWZaFxiVlfVdC2iEmOttf5QpwtL4C4HAUd9TE",
    "access_token": "8546457621466582-HCudBJNyQuWrgDgvph76iAmJ",
    "access_token_secret": "tJ2RCSPunaEqph76iAmJmMTcGGzMMFZDHx2ZkD33YYJ"
}
```
