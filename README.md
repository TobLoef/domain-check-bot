# @DomainCheckBot
A Twitter bot to check the availability of domains.

Just mention [@domaincheckbot](https://twitter.com/domaincheckbot) along with a domain, and it'll respond with the avilability status of the domain.

If you want to run this on your own machine, you'll need a keys.json file in the projects folder with your Twitter keys, like this:
```
{
    "consumer_key": "",
    "consumer_secret": "",
    "access_token": "",
    "access_token_secret": ""
}
```

If you find a bug or have a suggestion, feel free to open an issue.
